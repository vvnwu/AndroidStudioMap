## Built With

* [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented[ (although not a pure object-oriented language, as it contains primitive types[16][unreliable source?]), and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) - Android Studio is the official integrated development environment for Google's Android operating system, built on JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA software and designed specifically for Android development. It is available for download on Windows, macOS and Linux based operating systems.
* [IBM Cloudant](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloudant) - Cloudant is an IBM software product, which is primarily delivered as a cloud-based service. Cloudant is a non-relational, distributed database service of the same name. Cloudant is based on the Apache-backed CouchDB project and the open source BigCouch project.
